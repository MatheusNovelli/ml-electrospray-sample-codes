# ml-electrospray-sample-codes
This repository contains some samples of the codes I produced during my R&amp;D internship in NHL Stenden - University of Applied Sciences, where I worked with an automatic Electrospray system and classified its modes of operation using Machine Learning algorithms.

Since I can not provide the data files, as they belong to the research, the code can not be executed again. So assume that the output of the notebooks corresponds to the most updated version of the code.
